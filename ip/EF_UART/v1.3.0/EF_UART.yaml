  description: |
    UART, or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, is one of the most used device-to-device communication protocols. A UART enables two devices to exchange data serially without sharing the clock in a frame oriented way. The frame consists of a start bit, a number of data bits (typically one byte), a parity bit (optional) and 1-2 stop bits.
    EF_UART is a Soft IP with the following features:
    - A configurable frame format
      - Data bits could vary from 5 to 9 bits
      - Even, odd, stick, or no-parity bit generation/detection
      - One or Two stop bit generation
    - Line-break detection
    - Configurable receiver timeout
    - Loopback capability for testing/debugging
    - Glitch Filter on the RX pin when enabled.
    - Matching received data detection
    - 16-byte TX and RX FIFOs with programmable thresholds
    - 16-bit prescaler (PR) for programmable baud rate generation
    - Ten Interrupt Sources:
      + RX FIFO is full
      + TX FIFO is empty
      + RX FIFO level is above the set threshold
      + TX FIFO level is below the set threshold
      + Line break detection
      + Receiver data match
      + Frame Error
      + Parity Error
      + Overrun
      + Receiver timeout
