  description: " 
A 32-bit timer and PWM generator with the following features:

- 32-bit prescaler.

- Up Counting, Down Counting and Up/Down Counting.

- One-shot and Periodic.

- Two independent PWM channels with two compare registers.

- Optional PWM signal inversion.

- Configurable PWM dead time/band to generate PWM signals such as those required by a half-H bridge driver.

- Fault handling.
